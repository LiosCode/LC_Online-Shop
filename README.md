Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Important

To make this project work, please check the icons and pictures. If you like to use your own favicon, just switch the favicon file without changing the filename. If you want a different home button or company icon, check the page file for the source names and switch the target file without changing the name.

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
